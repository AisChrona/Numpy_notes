## What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It supports:
- Multidimensional arrays and matrices
- Mathematical operations on arrays
- Broadcasting, slicing, reshaping, and more

I completed this learning with full dedication and practical implementation. You can view my learning certificate soon (if applicable), or track my progress through this repository.

# What's Next?

 I will now start learning Pandas for powerful data analysis, and update my GitHub profile with practical notebooks and projects.
